# Mitigating syber threats
## Cyberthreat Intelligence (CTI) and mitigation strategies
-  CTI:
    - Evidence-based insights on cyber threats
    - Helps detect, prevent and respond to attacks
    - Focuses on the attackers motivations, tactics and indicators
- Types of CTI: 
    - Strategic:
        - Highest level, aimed at senior leadership. Covers broad trends and emerging risks, helping with long-term planning
    - Tactical:
        - Valuable to security analysts
        - Focuses on how attackers operate, their tools, techniques and procedures
    - Operational:
        - Real time insight into ongoing campaigns often used to adjust defenses immediately
    - Technical:
        - Most granular form of CTI
        - Includes specific details like malware hashes, malicious IP addresses or phishing domains.
- Why use CTI:
    - Early warning of threats
    - Informed risk decisions
    - Better detection and response
    - Tailored security measures
- CTI sources:
    - Organisational internal sources, like system locks, incident reports and user activity
    - Logs
    - Government advisories
    - Vendors
    - Sector-specific communities- ISACs
    - OS platforms and forums- OSINT
- CTI in practice:
    1. Collect data
    2. Analyse relevance and accuracy of data
    3. Correlate data with organisation and environment
    4. Act
    5. Review and refine

## Mitigation strategies
- MFA, to block unauthorised access
- Endpoint protection and firewalls to reduce attack surfaces
- Staff awareness training, to prevent social engineering attacks
- Regular patching and updates to fix vulnerabilities
- Maintaining secure backups
- Monitoring and alerts for suspicious activity

### Example: Defence against ransomware
- Block phishing emails with filters and staff training
- Limit user access (principle of least privilege)
- Regular offsite backups
- Have a tested incident response plan
- Detect lateral movement by monitoring systems.
